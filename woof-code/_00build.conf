## Would you like to strip all binary executables and shared library files?
## These are usually already stripped, although some packages may have the shared
## library files stripped with the '--strip-debug' option only, and extra stripping
## should be okay. It won't do any harm answering yes here.

## Puppy is normally run as the 'administrator' (root) user, though there is
## also 'fido' which is not currently very mature.
## The structure of Puppy is such that we consider root to be safe (with a full
## disclaimer of any responsibility if anything does go wrong), but there is a
## compromise, to run as root but to run Internet apps as user 'spot'.
## Note, in a running Puppy 'Menu->System->Login & Security Manager'
##    can be used to enable or disable running as spot.

## -- Xorg Auto --
## - This overrides DISTRO_XORG_AUTO in DISTRO_SPECS..
## - For ARM it's always set 'no' (may be changed)
## Do you want Xorg to start automatically at first boot (or at 'pfix=ram'
## kernel boot param) or run Xorg Wizard? The latter has been the case for
## earlier puppies. Automatic startup of X usually works, though in some
## cases may choose the wrong monitor resolution or driver -- which can be"
## fixed by running Xorg Wizard afterward. (yes/no)

## -- Locale --
## Puppy is built with a default locale LANG=en_US and keyboard layout KMAP=us,
## which may be changed after bootup.
## However, if you are building a language-specific Puppy, you may change the
## defaults. But, please do make sure that your Puppy has a 'langpack' PET
## for your language installed -- if one does not exist, then you will have to
## create one -- see MoManager in the Utility menu, also read the Menu -> Help
## -> HOWTO Internationalization.
## see valid locales in /usr/share/i18n/locales
## (the default is en_US.UTF-8)

## -- Keyboard layout --
